## About This project

I always found different techs amazing separately, but when combined, 
I struggle to understand how everything works. 

So the purpose of this project was to challenge myself with 3 different frameworks and see how the frontend
communicate with the backend api, and dealing with the lifecycle of data, from database creation
to crud of the table, mvc logic, and displaying it to the user at the end.


To run this project, you need to have node, mysql and php environments ready 
(I use laragon for php and sql, and vite for vue.js)

Check the package.json file to install all the dependencies that you need with npm install command.
